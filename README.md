## Introduction

Following the course provided on youtube by Luke Barousse, I was able to get a solid understanding of Power Bi and it's key features. The course covered important tools such as **Power Query, M Language, DAX, graphical visualisations and much more!**

Through following this course, I was able to build a couple of dashboards, both of which display information on the data job market in 2024. These included **metrics such as median pay, skills, country and education level.**
